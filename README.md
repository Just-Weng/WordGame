# Word Game

# About
Word Game is a Project that I completed in CSCI 212 - Object Oriented Programming in Java

This project is loosely based on a word puzzle called the Spelling Beehive found in the Sunday New
York Times magazine. In it, a player is given a set of seven letters and has to find as many words as
possible using some portion, but at least five, of those seven letters. Letters may be used more than
once. Each correct word earns one point.

This Project utilizes Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and utilizes the javax.swing library. It also
uses a custom built Singly Linked List Data Structure

# How To Play
*  Choose a text file containing all words that a user can choose from
*  Input word guesses in the input field (minimum 5 letters long, and must be entirely lowercase)
*  Each guess awards 1 point, if all letters in the guess bank is chosen, you are awarded 3 points
*  Game Ends when all words have been guessed, or when user inputs "STOP"
